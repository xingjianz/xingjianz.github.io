Hello there! I am Xingjian Zhao, currently a second year PhD student in Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), under the advisement of Dr. [Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri](https://mmamiri.github.io/). My research interests and prior experience span broadly across the field of Machine Learning, including Computer Vision, Multi-modal Transformers, and Reinforcement Learning. Recently I am conducting research on Machine Unlearning methods with theoratical guarentees, exploring ways to accomodate privacy regulations and mitigate risks such as contaminated data.



Prior to my PhD journey, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from Columbia University, and my two Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and mathematics from RPI.
